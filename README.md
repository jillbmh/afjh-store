# ReadMe - Project 2 | AFJH Store

## Description

This was our second project with SEI. It was a pair project, we had just 2 days to complete this one. 

You can find the link to this project on netlify, here: https://64f5fc719369b4070a913fcd--jhaf-store.netlify.app/

You can also find the code on my GitHub page: https://github.com/jillbmh/afjh-store

## Technologies Used

We used the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* SASS
* JavaScript
* A third party API
* Bootstrap
* React
* Netlify
* Insomnia

We were given the following brief:

## The idea

We wanted to create an ecommerce store with some basic GET and display functionality, we knew we wouldn't be able to do a full ecommerce store given the limited timeframe. We found a third party API: https://fakestoreapi.com/docs


## Getting Started

Once we had decided what to do, we started by creating the homepage wireframe.

We liked the idea of creating it mobile first and making it really modern. In the header we wanted a logo, burger menu, account and search icon. We researched colour themes and liked this pallet:

We used a shared google document to plan and list what we were each doing and Slack messages to keep each other up to date.

## Build/Code Process

We both jointly did the App.js and Index.js code and then divided up the components that we would work on. My partner did the filter by category and get all items component. I did the home page, the carousel and the get single item page. We both worked on the styling.

I used Bootstrap to import a carousel and created a function to choose the top 3 highest rated items for the carousel.

My plan was to get the functionality working and then make it more DRY if I had more time. I didn't get back to making it more dry but I was really pleased to do this functionality.

I used Bootstrap to add pretend buttons to the home page to make it look more realistic:

## Challenges and Wins

My biggest challenge for this project was the functionality for the carousel including sorting the items by rating, that was a win for me so early on in the course. I loved using Bootstrap as it showed me how quickly you can add things although it's more challenging to customise them.


## Key Learnings/Takeaways

The biggest area of learning for both me and my partner was the importance of clear naming conventions. We became confused at times as we hadn't named things as clearly as they could be so we were linking functions to incorrect pages which caused delays and errors. 


## Bugs & future improvements

There are no bugs that we are aware of although the API is temperamental so better error handling would improve the user experience vastly. 


## Other improvements:

* Better mobile responsiveness
* The nav icons we had originally wanted
* Search functionality
* A shopping cart
* Account functionality
